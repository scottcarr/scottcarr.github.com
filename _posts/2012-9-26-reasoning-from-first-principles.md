Kevin Rose (founder of digg.com) recently interviewed Elon Musk (of Tesla, SpaceX,
PayPal fame).

Rose asked Musk how he decided to undertake such ambitious projects as build electric cars
and rockets.  (Musk is the founder of SpaceX and Tesla Motors.) Musk replied
when those things will impact the future of humanity in the biggest way.

On the topic of advise for aspiring entrepreneurs, Musk gave two main points:

First, seek out negative feedback.  We love to be praised and hate to be criticized,
so we ignore negative feedback as a defense mechanism.  Another problem is:
the people whose opinion we value, are typically the same people who wouldn't want
to hurt our feelings (friends, family, close colleagues). 

His second piece of advice was reason from first principles - meaning drill
down to the most basic ideas, ones we know are true, and build up. Electric cars is 
based on the first principle: responsible energy production and consumption
is vital.  He wanted to pursue space exploration from a desire to colonize other
planets (and protect the survival of humanity - a very basic principle).

He contrasted reasoning by first principle to reasoning by simile.  An example
of reasoning by simile is, "Hardware startups are impossible because all the
successful startups I can think of are software."  The implication being good
startups must be *like* recent successful startups.
