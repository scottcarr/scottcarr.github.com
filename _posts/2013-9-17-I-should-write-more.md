title: I should write more
summary: Honestly, could I be writing less?

I'm reading <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siddhartha_(novel)">Siddhartha</a>.  I loved this snippet of Gotama and Siddhartha's conversation:
    
> ... worthy instruction does not contain; it does not contain the secret of what the Illustrious One himself experienced ... That is what I thought and realized when I heard your teachings.  That is why I am going on my way -- not ot seek another and better doctrine, for I know there is none, but to leave ll doctrines and all teacher and to reach my goal alone -- or die.

I can identify with Siddhartha's sentiment.  That's the point of the book, I suppose.  Education, in my experience, tends towards cramming in knowledge into pupils heads, versus letting them find their own way.  Starting to write more frequently is one way I'd like to rebalance.
