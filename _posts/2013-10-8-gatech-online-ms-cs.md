title: Georgia Tech's online MS CS
summary: My thoughts as a former online student
---

I took several online classes while I was working on my Master's and working a regular 9 to 5 at the same time.  Add to that a couple Udacity and Coursera courses, so I can speak to the pros/cons of online class with a bit of credibility.

We're in the infancy of MOOCs and there are plenty of reasons to be excited.  However, I'm hesitant to go as far as say they'll replace traditional universities.  Most the aspects that different MOOCs have both a pro and a con associated with them.

Classroom Experience
--------------------

The classroom experience of an MOOC and a 200 student lecture at Big State U are essentially the same.  I lean towards an MOOC being marginally better, because professors at Big State U are required to teach, while MOOC instructors are actively deciding to teach.  This is damning with faint praise.  Other MOOCs advantages include smaller chunks of content, rewinding/pausing, and interactivity.  Interactivity often takes the form of periodic quizes.  Many MOOCs are just recordings of a traditional lecture and the quizes are often trivially easy in my experience.  The biggest disadvantage is not being able to ask the lecturer questions.  

Convenience
-----------

Obviously watching a video online is convenient, but sitting at home at my computer is not my optimal learning environment.  Going to class and seeing the professor face-to-face triggers my brain into "pay attention mode."

I have a hard time believing the biggest hurdle to getting a Master's degree in CS is physically getting to a classroom.  However much effort that takes completing the course work takes orders of magnitude more.  Exceptions exist of course for students in other countries or similar situations.  I'd be very interested to see the data on how many students taking MOOCs live within say 30 minutes of a university.
