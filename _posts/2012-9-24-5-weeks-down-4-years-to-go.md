title: Five weeks down, 4 years to go
summary: Does time only fly when you're having fun?  Not under any other conditions?

I'm convinced one day I will look up and realize I'm not a graduate student 
anymore, with no memory of how I got there.  The first five weeks of
semester one have flown by.  In order to prevent my experiences from disappearing into the
void where my long term memory should be, I'll record them here.

Tonight I attended a diversity seminar.  I was anticipating struggling to stay awake.
It ended up being pretty interesting, but I see a missed opportunity.  The
seminar attendees looked like the United Nations.  We could have had a
fascinating discussion about the real diversity issues at a multi-cultural /
multi-national organization like Purdue.  The trick would be getting us
introverted science nerds to actually talk to each other.

Classes are going well - lots of homework.  I believe there is a correlation
between the number of TAs a professor has for a course and the amount of
homework assigned.

I've no idea how to measure research progress.  It feels like we're moving
forward.  Yesterday, I was considering writing a blog post reflection on a
quote by Einstein.

> If we knew what it was we were doing, it would not be called research, would
> it?

Depending on the situation, those words could be reassurance or a justification
for lack of progress. 

It's definitely not an "if an only if" statement.  Let us not be followed into
believing not knowing what we are doing implies we are doing research.
