title: Work like Woody Allen
summary: How do you make a great movie?  Try 60 times.

Woody Allen has credits in something like 50 or 60 movies.  In *Woody Allen: A
Documentry* he describes his work habit as immediately starting on the next
right after finishing a movie.  He figures if he makes enough movies, some of
them will be good.

I want to try embracing that philosphy more.  Recently, when I finished an
application I had been working on, I realized it'd be much cleaner if I'd
architected it differently.  Only by completely my initial version of the
application did I fully understand the problem I was trying to solve.  In this
case I was able to rewrite everything from scratch in using the new architecture
in a fraction of the time it took me originally.  Once I have the write
architecture / data structure in mind, the rest falls out.

The problem is not letting the perfect be the enemy of the good.  Woody
knows he needs to finish a movie by such-and-such a date.  Those are the terms
of his contract.  With software projects, especially personal ones, to throw
everything out and start over too often.  I'd say that it is important to
get the project to the point where its suitable for external criticism, but
Woody never reads his reviewers.  Perhaps internal critique is enough.
