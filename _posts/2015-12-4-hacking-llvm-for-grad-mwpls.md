[Midwest PL Summit](http://purdue-pl.github.io/PLSummit/) was an informal workshop held at Purdue on Dec 4.
I gave a talk based on my experience with LLVM.  In the talk, my goal was to
give a quick start guide for grad students new to LLVM and some tips
for more experienced LLVM users.  

My secret agenda was to get new tips from the audience.  If you have any
suggestions for how to improve or extend my talk, please contact me.  Email:
