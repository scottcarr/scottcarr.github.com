summary: Honestly, could I be writing less?

I'm reading [Siddhartha](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siddhartha_(novel)).  I loved this snippet of Gotama and Siddhartha's conversation:
    
    ... worthy instruction does not contain; it does not contain the secret of what the Illustrious One himself experienced ... That is what I thought and realized when I heard your teachings.  That is why I am going on my way -- not ot seek another and better doctrine, for I know there is none, but to leave all doctrines and all teacher and to reach my goal alone -- or die.

I can identify with Siddhartha's sentiment.  That's the point of the book, I suppose.  As a product of the US public school system, I've spent most my life cramming teachings into my brain and "finding my own way" only peripherally.  Starting to write more frequently is one way I'd like to rebalance towards exploration.
