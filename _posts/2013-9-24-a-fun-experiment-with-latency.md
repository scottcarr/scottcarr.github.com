title: A fun experiment with latency
summary: In which I explain how to see your own eye move

This experiment has two parts.  All you need for the first part is a mirror (and working vision).  A bathroom mirror works well.  Stand in front of the mirror and lean forward a little until your face is about 6 inches from the mirror's surface.  Now look all the way to your left (or right) and then look back to center as quickly as possible.  Your goal is to see your eye in an intermediate state, somewhere between all the way left (or right) and center.  Spoiler alert, it's impossible because of [saccadic masking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccadic_masking).

But your eye really is moving in a nice smooth motion, and if you have an iPhone you don't have to take my word for it.  Turn on your iPhone and open up Camera (this works equally well with any similar phone/program that does "live" streaming of what it's seeing).  Switch to the front camera, so you see a nice big picture of your face filling most of the screen.  Now do the same eye movement experiment as before.  If you're quick, you'll see your eye moving.  The phone is having to record, process, and display the image and each step imposes some delay.  You're seeing what the camera recorded a fraction of a second ago -- a glimpse into the past.
