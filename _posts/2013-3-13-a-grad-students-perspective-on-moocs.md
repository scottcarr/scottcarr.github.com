title: A Graduate Student's Perspective on MOOCs
summary: And what they mean for universities
---

##Why should you listen to me?

My academic career is more diverse than most.  I've attended:
- A small private school
- A satellite campus
- Online courses provided by a traditional university
- A main campus of a large research university (and worked for another)
- Multiple MOOCs from different providers

I've experienced most of what US higher education has to offer in terms of instruction,
and I hope you'll agree that lends credibility to my perspective on [MOOCs.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course) 

##It's the end of the world as we know it?

All the talk of MOOCs "disrupting" traditional universities is premature.  To be
crass: until mega-corporations except MOOC certificates as a valid credential
and the US government grants student visas to attend a MOOCs, traditional US universities 
will have a steady stream of students.

The sad part is those items don't have anything to do with the educational 
experience at traditional universities being better. The quality of the experience
may end up being irrelevant because it's difficult to measure.

##The experience at a traditional university is better.  Isn't it?

I won't pretend to be an expert on education, but even I can tell
the 100+ student lecture is essentially an MOOC.  When a student can't 
interact with the instructor one-on-one, they might as
well be in a class with a million other students.  I don't know why some
professors seem to have as a default answer "Ask the TA," or "Read the syllabus,"
but having been asked the same 100 questions from a different group of 100
students year after year has to be a factor.

Sure, a traditional university with small classes and direct interaction with
the professor blows the pants of an MOOC, but most universities conceded
the small class size fight for at least the core classes.  Upper
level and graduate courses might be a different story depending on the institution.
