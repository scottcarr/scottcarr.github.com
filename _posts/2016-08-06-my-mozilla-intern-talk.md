title: My Mozilla Intern Talk
summary: A video recording of my talk on MIR optimizations in the Rust compiler from Mozilla San Francisco
---

I've been interning at Mozilla in San Francisco this summer.  It felt
like the shortest summer ever. As the saying goes, time flies when you're
having fun.  

Many more blog posts are to come, but for now, my intern talk video is below.
Each Mozilla intern gives at ten minute talk towards the end of their
internship.  Ten minutes isn't much time, definitely not enough to give the
details of 12 months worth of work, but my talk gives an overview and there are
more details under the "Additional Links" tab of my talk's page on [Air
Mozilla.](https://air.mozilla.org/making-mir-fly/)
